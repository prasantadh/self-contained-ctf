# Lab setup using Vagrant and Ansible

```bash
# when memory allocation fails, it is because vagrant cache is full you can drop them using
sudo sh -c "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
# there are current issues with the current setup. we can open root shell but not regular shell. however, works for demo purposes
```
